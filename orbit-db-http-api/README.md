### This demonstration requires SSL/TLS localhost using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation)(development purposes only) 
   
1. Install mkcert [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases) or commands:
```shell
brew install mkcert
brew install nss    # If using Firefox
```
   
2. Run `mkcert` in the `/certs` directory:
```shell
cd $PWD/../certs
mkcert localhost "*.localhost" localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```
results: 
```console
Note: the local CA is not installed in the system trust store.
Run "mkcert -install" for certificates to be trusted automatically ‚ö†Ô∏è

Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
 - "localhost"
 - "*.localhost"
   Warning: many browsers don't support second-level wildcards like "*.localhost" ‚ö†Ô∏è
 - "localhost"
 - "127.0.0.1"
 - "::1"

Reminder: X.509 wildcards only go one level deep, so this won't match a.b.localhost ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The certificate is at "./localhost+4.pem" and the key at "./localhost+4-key.pem" ‚úÖ

It will expire on 5 November 2023 üóì
```

3. Run from `docker-compose.yml`
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
